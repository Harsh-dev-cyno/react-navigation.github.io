Here's an improved version of the documentation with a few adjustments:

Want to help improve the documentation? That would be greatly appreciated. Here's some information on how to contribute.

## Philosophy of Documentation

- _Document the challenging parts as much as the good parts._ It's better for users to know that we don't have an ideal solution to their problem and provide preferred workarounds, rather than having them search through obscure StackOverflow threads.

- _Provide runnable examples where possible._ Learning through interacting with code is a key reason why REPLs (Read-Eval-Print Loops) are so popular. Thanks to [Snack](https://snack.expo.io), we can provide a similar experience for React Navigation users.

- _Be honest about the tradeoffs and limitations._ We explain the pros and cons of React Navigation and suggest alternative libraries if React Navigation might not be a good fit. We should maintain a similar level of honesty at finer levels of granularity.

## Things Anyone Can Do

### Run it Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. Run `yarn start` to start the local development server.

### Make Changes

- Each documentation version of `react-navigation` is generated from the Markdown files located in the `versioned_docs` folder. Change these files, and the changes will be reflected when you refresh the page while running the documentation locally.

- If you want to add a new page, you need to add it to the corresponding [sidebars.json file](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation.github.io/tree/main/versioned_sidebars) and then restart the server.

## Things You Need to be a Collaborator to Do

_Deployment is done automatically via GitHub Actions. Normally, you shouldn't need to do these tasks._

### Download the Latest Translations

- Configure the `CROWDIN_DOCUSAURUS_PROJECT_ID` and `CROWDIN_DOCUSAURUS_API_KEY` environment variables (ask [@brentvatne](https://github.com/brentvatne) if you need access).
- Run `yarn crowdin-upload` and then `yarn crowdin-download`.

### Update the Sponsors List

- Create a GitHub "Personal Access Token" [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and set the `read:org` scope on it.
- Set the environment variable `REACT_NAV_GITHUB_TOKEN` to that value.
- Run `yarn fetch-sponsors`.
- Commit the updated `sponsors.js` file.

### Deploy it

_Before deploying, be sure to download the latest translations!_

Only collaborators on this repository can deploy. Run the following command from the `main` branch:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> \
CURRENT_BRANCH=main \
USE_SSH=true \
yarn deploy
```
